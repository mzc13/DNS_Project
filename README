1. Our client first connects to the root server and then sends a random
string to get the hostname of the top level server. Then it connects to
the top level server and starts sending queries line by line. If the
root server sends back an NS response, the client queries the top level
server and writes the response received to the output file.

2. Everything in our code is working according to the instructions.

3. The hardest part was probably designing the data structure required
for the DNS tables. We started by splitting each line from the table
entry files and then using the hostname to point to the IP and record.
The problem with this approach was that we could not handle case
insensitive lookups. The way we fixed this was by turning the hostname
to a lowercase string and then having it map to the line from the table
file in a dictionary; and we had a special 'NS' entry in the dictionary
to handle cases where the entry was not in the root server's table.

4. We learned how to use multiple sockets in a python project, how to
detect when a socket closes, and the basics of how DNS queries work.
