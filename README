2. When the LS received a request from the client it would send a
request to both TS servers. In our code we implemented a 6 second
timeout using the Python select module which waited to see if the
sockets received any data in their buffers within the time period. If no
socket responded, the LS would send back an error to the client.
Otherwise, we check which socket responded to the query and append that
server's hostname to the end of the DNS record and send it back to the
client.

3. Everything in our code is working according to the instructions.

4. The hardest part was figuring out exactly what select() does since
all the documentation online just says that it is equivalent to the UNIX
select() function without describing what that means. Eventually, after
reading some code examples we figured out how to use it.

5. We learned how to use a server as a relay point to help direct the
flow of network traffic. We also learned how to use multiple sockets and
timeouts to control our response and give accurate results.
