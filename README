2. When the LS received a request from the client it would send a 
request to both TS servers. In our code we implemented a 6 second
timeout using the Python select library which waited to see if the
socket was able to form a connection. If a connection was found,
we checked to see which socket formed the connection and received the
response. We then appended the server name to the end of the response
that LS sends to the client. The Python select library made it so that
after a timeout, we saw that neither socket formed a connection and we
sent a response back to the client accordingly.

3. Everything in our code is working according to the instructions.

4. The hardest part was probably ...

5. We learned how to use a server as a relay point to help direct the
flow of network traffic. We also learned how to use multiple sockets and
timeouts to control our response and give accurate results.
